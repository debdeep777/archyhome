# To set up wifi after issuing wifi-menu where the access point was called "TIFRCAM"

# To setup wifi after system upgrade, (I'm guessing, not verified)
# netctl disable netctl-auto@wlp6s0.service
# netctl-auto disable-all
# ifconfig wlp6s0 up
# wifi-menu

ifconfig wlp6s0 up
systemctl enable netctl-auto@wlp6s0.service	# In stead of these two lines
systemctl start  netctl-auto@wlp6s0.service	# the original line had: restart
netctl-auto enable TIFRCAM
dhcpcd wlp6s0
